The Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS): a lumped rainfall-runoff model for catchments with shallow groundwater
------

The Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS) is a novel rainfall-runoff model to fill the gap between complex, spatially
distributed models which are often used in lowland catchments and
simple, parametric  (conceptual) models which have mostly been developed for
sloping catchments. WALRUS explicitly accounts for processes
that are important in lowland areas, notably (1)
groundwater-unsaturated zone coupling, (2) wetness-dependent flow
routes, (3) groundwater-surface water feedbacks and (4) seepage and
surface water supply. WALRUS consists of a coupled
groundwater-vadose zone reservoir, a quickflow reservoir and
a surface water reservoir.  WALRUS is suitable for operational use
because it is computationally efficient and numerically stable
(achieved with a flexible time step approach). In the open source
model code default relations have been implemented, leaving only
four parameters which require calibration. For research purposes,
these defaults can easily be changed.

**Code availability**

The WALRUS code is available as an R-package through this GitHub (WALRUS_1.0.tar.gz). If you want to be kept informed about WALRUS developments, please send me an email (claudia.brauer-at-wur.nl) so I can add you to my WALRUS-update-mailing-list. You can also visit this site from time to time of course.

**Documentation**

WALRUS and its first applications have been published in two peer reviewed, open access, scientific journals:

To facilitate application of WALRUS, we wrote a [user manual](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/WALRUS/blob/master/documentation/WALRUS_manual.pdf), which is provided in the documentation-folder, together with the two papers.

**User contributions**

We would like to add a folder to this GitHub with examples of applications from different users, so we can learn from each other. So, if you used WALRUS, we would be very much interested in your results. In addition, if you have comments or points for improvement of the model or the manual, please let me know (email claudia.brauer-at-wur.nl).
