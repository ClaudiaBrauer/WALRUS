The Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS): a rainfall-runoff model for catchments with shallow groundwater
------

The Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS) is a novel rainfall--
runoff model to fill the gap between complex, spatially
distributed models which are often used in lowland catchments and
simple, parametric  (conceptual) models which have mostly been developed for
sloping catchments. WALRUS explicitly accounts for processes
that are important in lowland areas, notably (1)
groundwater-unsaturated zone coupling, (2) wetness-dependent flow
routes, (3) groundwater-surface water feedbacks and (4) seepage and
surface water supply. WALRUS consists of a coupled
groundwater-vadose zone reservoir, a quickflow reservoir and
a surface water reservoir.  WALRUS is suitable for operational use
because it is computationally efficient and numerically stable
(achieved with a flexible time step approach). In the open source
model code default relations have been implemented, leaving only
four parameters which require calibration. For research purposes,
these defaults can easily be changed. 


**Code availability**

The WALRUS code will be made available as an R-package through this GitHub somewhere in September. If you want to be kept informed about WALRUS developments, please send me an email so I can add you to my WALRUS-update-mailing-list. You can also visit this site from time to time of course.


**Documentation**

WALRUS will be published soon in two peer reviewed, open access, scientific journals: *Geoscientific Model Development* and *Hydrology and Earth System Sciences*. We expect that the final papers will become available at the end of September. Until then, you can read the papers in their in their discussions (pre-review) stage:
