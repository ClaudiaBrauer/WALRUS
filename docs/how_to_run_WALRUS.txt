How to run the Wageningen Lowland Runoff Simulator (WALRUS)

The model code is written in R, but can be easily translated into any vector-oriented interpreted language. The code consists of several scripts. Two functions form the core of the model code: WALRUS_loop and WALRUS_step. In WALRUS_loop the initial conditions are set, a for-loop over each time step is run and output data are organized. For every time step, the function WALRUS_step is called, which contains the actual model computations. Some additional scripts provide help by preprocessing forcing data, setting default parameters, and postprocessing of the model output: figures, water balance computations and analysis of residuals. Another script provides a template in which functions are called for preprocessing, calibrating, running the model and postprocessing.

All functions are combined in an R package called WALRUS. A manual will follow shortly.
