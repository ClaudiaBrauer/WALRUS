Parallel coordinates (under construction)
------

This is an example of an interactive parallel coordinate plot, which can be used to explore the parameter space.

**Parameters and diagnostics**

Here, I varied 6 parameters and catchment characteristics, ran the model  


**Try-it-yourself examples**

Which parameters cause much evapotranspiration reduction? Select only low values of ETred. You'll see that these results belong to runs with deep channels (cD high). When channels are deep, groundwater has to become deeper to get the same drainage flux. When groundwater is deep, the top soil is dry. When the top soil is dry, evapotranspiration is reduced.
